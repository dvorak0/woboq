<doc f='include/glog/logging.h' l='1372'>// Redefine this to implement waiting for
  // the sink&apos;s logging logic to complete.
  // It will be called after each send() returns,
  // but before that LogMessage exits or crashes.
  // By default this function does nothing.
  // Using this function one can implement complex logic for send()
  // that itself involves logging; and do all this w/o causing deadlocks and
  // inconsistent rearrangement of log messages.
  // E.g. if a LogSink has thread-specific actions, the send() method
  // can simply add the message to a queue and wake up another thread that
  // handles real logging while itself making some LOG() calls;
  // WaitTillSent() can be implemented to wait for that logic to complete.
  // See our unittest for an example.</doc>
