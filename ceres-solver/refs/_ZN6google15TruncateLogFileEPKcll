<doc f='include/glog/logging.h' l='1451'>// Truncate a log file that may be the append-only output of multiple
// processes and hence can&apos;t simply be renamed/reopened (typically a
// stdout/stderr).  If the file &quot;path&quot; is &gt; &quot;limit&quot; bytes, copy the
// last &quot;keep&quot; bytes to offset 0 and truncate the rest. Since we could
// be racing with other writers, this approach has the potential to
// lose very small amounts of data. For security, only follow symlinks
// if the path is /proc/self/fd/*</doc>
