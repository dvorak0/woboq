<doc f='include/suitesparse/cholmod_core.h' l='810'>/* fault with one matrix of order n = 3005 and
				 * nz = 6,036,025.  This is a very dense graph.
     * The workaround is to use AMD instead of METIS for matrices of dimension
     * greater than Common-&gt;metis_nswitch (default 3000) or more and with
     * density of Common-&gt;metis_dswitch (default 0.66) or more.
     * cholmod_nested_dissection has no problems with the same matrix, even
     * though it uses METIS_NodeComputeSeparator on this matrix.  If this
     * seg fault does not affect you, set metis_nswitch to zero or less,
     * and CHOLMOD will not switch to AMD based just on the density of the
     * matrix (it will still switch to AMD if the metis_memory parameter
     * causes the switch).
