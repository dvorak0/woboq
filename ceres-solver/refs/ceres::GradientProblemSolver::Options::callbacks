<doc f='ceres-solver/include/ceres/gradient_problem_solver.h' l='256'>// Callbacks that are executed at the end of each iteration of the
    // Minimizer. An iteration may terminate midway, either due to
    // numerical failures or because one of the convergence tests has
    // been satisfied. In this case none of the callbacks are
    // executed.

    // Callbacks are executed in the order that they are specified in
    // this vector. By default, parameter blocks are updated only at
    // the end of the optimization, i.e when the Minimizer
    // terminates. This behaviour is controlled by
    // update_state_every_variable. If the user wishes to have access
    // to the update parameter blocks when his/her callbacks are
    // executed, then set update_state_every_iteration to true.
