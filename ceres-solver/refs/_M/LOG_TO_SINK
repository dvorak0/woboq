// For LOG_TO_SINK we then do normal LOG(severity) logging as well.
// This is useful for capturing messages and passing/storing them
// somewhere more specific than the global log of the process.
// Argument types:
//   LogSink* sink;
//   LogSeverity severity;
// The cast is to disambiguate NULL arguments.</doc>
