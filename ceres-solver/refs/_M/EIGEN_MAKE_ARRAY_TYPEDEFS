  * \ingroup Core_Module
  *
  * Eigen defines several typedef shortcuts for most common 1D and 2D array types.
  *
  * The general patterns are the following:
  *
  * \c ArrayRowsColsType where \c Rows and \c Cols can be \c 2,\c 3,\c 4 for fixed size square matrices or \c X for dynamic size,
  * and where \c Type can be \c i for integer, \c f for float, \c d for double, \c cf for complex float, \c cd
  * for complex double.
  *
  * For example, \c Array33d is a fixed-size 3x3 array type of doubles, and \c ArrayXXf is a dynamic-size matrix of floats.
  *
  * There are also \c ArraySizeType which are self-explanatory. For example, \c Array4cf is
  * a fixed-size 1D array of 4 complex floats.
