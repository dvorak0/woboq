   All versions of SuiteSparseQR will include the following definitions.
   As an example, to test if the version you are using is 1.3 or later:
  
        if (SPQR_VERSION &gt;= SPQR_VER_CODE (1,3)) ...
  
   This also works during compile-time:
  
        #if SPQR_VERSION &gt;= SPQR_VER_CODE (1,3)
            printf (&quot;This is version 1.3 or later\n&quot;) ;
        #else
            printf (&quot;This is version is earlier than 1.3\n&quot;) ;
        #endif
