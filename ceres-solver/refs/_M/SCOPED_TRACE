<doc f='ceres-solver/internal/ceres/gtest/gtest.h' l='21070'>// Causes a trace (including the source file path, the current line
// number, and the given message) to be included in every test failure
// message generated by code in the current scope.  The effect is
// undone when the control leaves the current scope.
//
// The message argument can be anything streamable to std::ostream.
//
// In the implementation, we include the current line number as part
// of the dummy variable name, thus allowing multiple SCOPED_TRACE()s
// to appear in the same block - as long as they are on different
// lines.</doc>
