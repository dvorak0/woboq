<doc f='include/glog/logging.h' l='536'>// If a non-NULL pointer is given, we push the message onto the end
// of a vector of strings; otherwise, we report it with LOG(severity).
// This is handy for capturing messages and perhaps passing them back
// to the caller, rather than reporting them immediately.
// Argument types:
//   LogSeverity severity;
//   vector&lt;string&gt; *outvec;
// The cast is to disambiguate NULL arguments.</doc>
