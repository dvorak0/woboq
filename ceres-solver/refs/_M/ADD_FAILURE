<doc f='ceres-solver/internal/ceres/gtest/gtest.h' l='20397'>// Macros for indicating success/failure in test code.

// ADD_FAILURE unconditionally adds a failure to the current test.
// SUCCEED generates a success - it doesn&apos;t automatically make the
// current test successful, as a test is only successful when it has
// no failure.
//
// EXPECT_* verifies that a certain condition is satisfied.  If not,
// it behaves like ADD_FAILURE.  In particular:
//
//   EXPECT_TRUE  verifies that a Boolean condition is true.
//   EXPECT_FALSE verifies that a Boolean condition is false.
//
// FAIL and ASSERT_* are similar to ADD_FAILURE and EXPECT_*, except
// that they will also abort the current function on failure.  People
// usually want the fail-fast behavior of FAIL and ASSERT_*, but those
// writing data-driven tests often find themselves using ADD_FAILURE
// and EXPECT_* more.

// Generates a nonfatal failure with a generic message.</doc>
