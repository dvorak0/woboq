<doc f='include/c++/4.8/tr1/hashtable_policy.h' l='372'>// Default ranged hash function H.  In principle it should be a
  // function object composed from objects of type H1 and H2 such that
  // h(k, N) = h2(h1(k), N), but that would mean making extra copies of
  // h1 and h2.  So instead we&apos;ll just use a tag to tell class template
  // hashtable to do that composition.</doc>
