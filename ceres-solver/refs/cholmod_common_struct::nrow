<doc f='include/suitesparse/cholmod_core.h' l='827'>/* CHOLMOD has several routines that take less time than the size of
     * workspace they require.  Allocating and initializing the workspace would
     * dominate the run time, unless workspace is allocated and initialized
     * just once.  CHOLMOD allocates this space when needed, and holds it here
     * between calls to CHOLMOD.  cholmod_start sets these pointers to NULL
     * (which is why it must be the first routine called in CHOLMOD).
     * cholmod_finish frees the workspace (which is why it must be the last
     * call to CHOLMOD).
