<doc f='ceres-solver/include/ceres/types.h' l='253'>// Nonliner conjugate gradient methods are a generalization of the
// method of Conjugate Gradients for linear systems. The
// generalization can be carried out in a number of different ways
// leading to number of different rules for computing the search
// direction. Ceres provides a number of different variants. For more
