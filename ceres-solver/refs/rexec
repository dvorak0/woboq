   CMD.  The process runs at the remote machine using the ID of user

   to the socket for the connection is returned.  When the function
   returns *AHOST contains the official host name.

   This function is not part of POSIX and therefore no official
   cancellation point.  But due to similarity with an POSIX interface
   or due to the implementation it is a cancellation point and
   therefore not marked with __THROW.  */</doc>
