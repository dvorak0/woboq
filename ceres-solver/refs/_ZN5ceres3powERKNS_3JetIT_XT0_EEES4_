<doc f='ceres-solver/include/ceres/jet.h' l='718'>// pow -- both base and exponent are differentiable functions. This has a
// variety of special cases that require careful handling.
//
// 1. For f &gt; 0:
//    (f + df)^(g + dg) ~= f^g + f^(g - 1) * (g * df + f * log(f) * dg)
//    The numerical evaluation of f * log(f) for f &gt; 0 is well behaved, even for
//    extremely small values (e.g. 1e-99).
//
// 2. For f == 0 and g &gt; 1: (f + df)^(g + dg) ~= 0
//    This cases is needed because log(0) can not be evaluated in the f &gt; 0
//    expression. However the function f*log(f) is well behaved around f == 0
//    and its limit as f--&gt;0 is zero.
//
// 3. For f == 0 and g == 1: (f + df)^(g + dg) ~= 0 + df
//
// 4. For f == 0 and 0 &lt; g &lt; 1: The value is finite but the derivatives are not.
//
// 5. For f == 0 and g &lt; 0: The value and derivatives of f^g are not finite.
//
// 6. For f == 0 and g == 0: The C standard incorrectly defines 0^0 to be 1
//    &quot;because there are applications that can exploit this definition&quot;. We
//    (arbitrarily) decree that derivatives here will be nonfinite, since that
//    is consistent with the behavior for f == 0, g &lt; 0 and 0 &lt; g &lt; 1.
//    Practically any definition could have been justified because mathematical
//    consistency has been lost at this point.
//
// 7. For f &lt; 0, g integer, dg == 0: (f + df)^(g + dg) ~= f^g + g * f^(g - 1) df
//    This is equivalent to the case where f is a differentiable function and g
//    is a constant (to first order).
//
// 8. For f &lt; 0, g integer, dg != 0: The value is finite but the derivatives are
//    not, because any change in the value of g moves us away from the point
//    with a real-valued answer into the region with complex-valued answers.
//
// 9. For f &lt; 0, g noninteger: The value and derivatives of f^g are not finite.</doc>
