<doc f='include/suitesparse/cholmod_modify.h' l='154'>/* cholmod_rowadd adds a row to the LDL&apos; factorization.  It computes the kth
 * row and kth column of L, and then updates the submatrix L (k+1:n,k+1:n)
 * accordingly.  The kth row and column of L must originally be equal to the
 * kth row and column of the identity matrix.  The kth row/column of L is
 * computed as the factorization of the kth row/column of the matrix to
 * factorize, which is provided as a single n-by-1 sparse matrix R. */</doc>
