<doc f='include/glog/logging.h' l='1572'>// Install a signal handler that will dump signal information and a stack
// trace when the program crashes on certain signals.  We&apos;ll install the
// signal handler for the following signals.
//
// SIGSEGV, SIGILL, SIGFPE, SIGABRT, SIGBUS, and SIGTERM.
//
// By default, the signal handler will write the failure dump to the
// standard error.  You can customize the destination by installing your
// own writer function by InstallFailureWriter() below.
//
// Note on threading:
//
// The function should be called before threads are created, if you want
// to use the failure signal handler for all threads.  The stack trace
// will be shown only for the thread that receives the signal.  In other
// words, stack traces of other threads won&apos;t be shown.</doc>
