       *  This exchanges the elements between two multimaps in constant time.
       *  (It is only swapping a pointer, an integer, and an instance of
       *  the @c Compare type (which itself is often stateless and empty), so it
       *  should be quite fast.)

       *  std::swap(m1,m2) will feed to this function.
