<doc f='ceres-solver/internal/ceres/gmock/gmock.h' l='9814'>// An object of this type causes all EXPECT_CALL() statements
// encountered in its scope to be put in an anonymous sequence.  The
// work is done in the constructor and destructor.  You should only
// create an InSequence object on the stack.
//
// The sole purpose for this class is to support easy definition of
// sequential expectations, e.g.
//
//   {
//     InSequence dummy;  // The name of the object doesn&apos;t matter.
//
//     // The following expectations must match in the order they appear.
//     EXPECT_CALL(a, Bar())...;
//     EXPECT_CALL(a, Baz())...;
//     ...
//     EXPECT_CALL(b, Xyz())...;
//   }
//
// You can create InSequence objects in multiple threads, as long as
// they are used to affect different mock objects.  The idea is that
// each thread can create and set up its own mocks as if it&apos;s the only
// thread.  However, for clarity of your tests we recommend you to set
// up mocks in the main thread unless you have a good reason not to do
// so.</doc>
