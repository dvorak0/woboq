       *  @brief Erases a [__first,__last) range of elements from a %map.
       *  @param  __first  Iterator pointing to the start of the range to be
       *                   erased.
       *  @param __last Iterator pointing to the end of the range to

       *  This function erases a sequence of elements from a %map.
       *  Note that this function only erases the element, and that if
       *  the element is itself a pointer, the pointed-to memory is not touched
       *  in any way.  Managing the pointer is the user&apos;s responsibility.
