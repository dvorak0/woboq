<doc f='include/glog/logging.h' l='1521'>// glibc has traditionally implemented two incompatible versions of
// strerror_r(). There is a poorly defined convention for picking the
// version that we want, but it is not clear whether it even works with
// all versions of glibc.
// So, instead, we provide this wrapper that automatically detects the
// version that is in use, and then implements POSIX semantics.
// N.B. In addition to what POSIX says, we also guarantee that &quot;buf&quot; will
// be set to an empty string, if this function failed. This means, in most
// cases, you do not need to check the error code and you can directly
// use the value of &quot;buf&quot;. It will never have an undefined value.</doc>
