      *
      *	\returns a const reference to a matrix with the internal representation
      *	         of the decomposition.
      *
      * \pre Either the constructor HessenbergDecomposition(const MatrixType&amp;)
      * or the member function compute(const MatrixType&amp;) has been called
      * before to compute the Hessenberg decomposition of a matrix.
      *
      * The returned matrix contains the following information:
      *  - the upper part and lower sub-diagonal represent the Hessenberg matrix H
      *  - the rest of the lower part contains the Householder vectors that, combined with
      *    Householder coefficients returned by householderCoefficients(),
      *    allows to reconstruct the matrix Q as
      *       \f$ Q = H_{N-1} \ldots H_1 H_0 \f$.
      *    Here, the matrices \f$ H_i \f$ are the Householder transformations
      *       \f$ H_i = (I - h_i v_i v_i^T) \f$
      *    where \f$ h_i \f$ is the \f$ i \f$th Householder coefficient and
      *    \f$ v_i \f$ is the Householder vector defined by
      *       \f$ v_i = [ 0, \ldots, 0, 1, M(i+2,i), \ldots, M(N-1,i) ]^T \f$
      *    with M the matrix returned by this function.
      *
      * See LAPACK for further details on this packed storage.

      * Example: \include HessenbergDecomposition_packedMatrix.cpp
      * Output: \verbinclude HessenbergDecomposition_packedMatrix.out
