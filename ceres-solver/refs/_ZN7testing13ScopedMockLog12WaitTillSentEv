  // It will be executed after send() and after the global logging lock is
  // released, so calls within it (or rather within the Log() method called
  // within) may also issue LOG() statements.

  // LOG(), send(), WaitTillSent() and Log() will occur in the same thread for
  // a given log message.</doc>
