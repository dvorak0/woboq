       *  @brief  Simple multiple-character extraction.
       *  @param  __s  Pointer to an array.
       *  @param  __n  Maximum number of characters to store in @a __s.
       *  @param  __delim  A &quot;stop&quot; character.
       *  @return  *this
       *
       *  Characters are extracted and stored into @a __s until one of the
       *  following happens:
       *
       *  - @c __n-1 characters are stored
       *  - the input sequence reaches EOF
       *  - the next character equals @a __delim, in which case the character
       *    is not extracted
       *
       * If no characters are stored, failbit is set in the stream&apos;s error
       * state.
       *
       * In any case, a null character is stored into the next location in
       * the array.
       *
       *  @note  This function is not overloaded on signed char and
       *         unsigned char.
