// the quantity of &quot;potentially leaked&quot; reports emitted by memory
// debugging tools such as valgrind.  It is not required for normal
// operation, or for the google perftools heap-checker.  It must only
// be called when the process is about to exit, and all threads that
// might access flags are quiescent.  Referencing flags after this is
// called will have unexpected consequences.  This is not safe to run
// when multiple threads might be running: the function is
// thread-hostile.</doc>
