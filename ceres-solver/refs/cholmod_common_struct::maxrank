<doc f='include/suitesparse/cholmod_core.h' l='438'>/* rank of maximum update/downdate.  Valid values:
			 * 2, 4, or 8.  A value &lt; 2 is set to 2, and a
	* value &gt; 8 is set to 8.  It is then rounded up to the next highest
	* power of 2, if not already a power of 2.  Workspace (Xwork, below) of
	* size nrow-by-maxrank double&apos;s is allocated for the update/downdate.
	* If an update/downdate of rank-k is requested, with k &gt; maxrank,
	* it is done in steps of maxrank.  Default: 8, which is fastest.
	* Memory usage can be reduced by setting maxrank to 2 or 4.
