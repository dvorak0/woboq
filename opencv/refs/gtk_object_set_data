<doc f='include/gtk-2.0/gtk/gtkobject.h' l='169'>/* Set &apos;data&apos; to the &quot;object_data&quot; field of the object. The
 *  data is indexed by the &quot;key&quot;. If there is already data
 *  associated with &quot;key&quot; then the new data will replace it.
 *  If &apos;data&apos; is NULL then this call is equivalent to
 *  &apos;gtk_object_remove_data&apos;.
 *  The gtk_object_set_data_full variant acts just the same,
 *  but takes an additional argument which is a function to
 *  be called when the data is removed.
 *  `gtk_object_remove_data&apos; is equivalent to the above,
 *  where &apos;data&apos; is NULL
 *  `gtk_object_get_data&apos; gets the data associated with &quot;key&quot;.
