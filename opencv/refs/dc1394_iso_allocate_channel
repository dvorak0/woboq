 * dc1394_iso_allocate_channel:
 * @param camera A camera handle.
 * @param channels_allowed A bitmask of acceptable channels for the allocation.
 *   The LSB corresponds to channel 0 and the MSB corresponds to channel
 *   63.  Only channels whose bit is set will be considered for the allocation.
 *   If \a channels_allowed = 0, the complete set of channels supported by
 *   this camera will be considered for the allocation.
 * @param channel The allocated channel number is returned here.
 *
 * Allocates an isochronous channel.  This
 * function may be called multiple times, each time allocating an additional
 * channel.  The channel is automatically re-allocated if there is a bus
 * reset.  The channel is automatically released when this dc1394camera_t
 * is freed or if the application shuts down prematurely.  If the channel
 * needs to persist beyond the lifetime of this application, call
 * \a dc1394_iso_set_persist() first.  Note that this function does _not_
 * automatically program @a camera to use the allocated channel for isochronous
 * streaming.  You must do that manually using \a dc1394_video_set_iso_channel().
 *
 * @return \a DC1394_SUCCESS if the operation succeeded.  The allocated
 * channel is stored in \a channel. \a DC1394_FUNCTION_NOT_SUPPORTED if the
 * current driver/platform does not allow channel allocation.
 * \a DC1394_NO_ISO_CHANNEL if none of the requested channels are available.
