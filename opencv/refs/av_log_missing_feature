 * Log a generic warning message about a missing feature. This function is
 * intended to be used internally by Libav (libavcodec, libavformat, etc.)
 * only, and would normally not be used by applications.
 * @param[in] avc a pointer to an arbitrary struct of which the first field is
 * a pointer to an AVClass struct
 * @param[in] feature string containing the name of the missing feature
 * @param[in] want_sample indicates if samples are wanted which exhibit this feature.
 * If want_sample is non-zero, additional verbage will be added to the log
 * message which tells the user how to report samples to the development
 * mailing list.
