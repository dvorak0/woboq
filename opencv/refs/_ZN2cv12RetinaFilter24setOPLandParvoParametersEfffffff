    * setup the OPL and IPL parvo channels
    * @param beta1: gain of the horizontal cells network, if 0, then the mean value of the output is zero (default value), if the parameter is near 1, the amplitude is boosted but it should only be used for values rescaling... if needed
    * @param tau1: the time constant of the first order low pass filter of the photoreceptors, use it to cut high temporal frequencies (noise or fast motion), unit is frames, typical value is 1 frame
    * @param k1: the spatial constant of the first order low pass filter of the photoreceptors, use it to cut high spatial frequencies (noise or thick contours), unit is pixels, typical value is 1 pixel
    * @param beta2: gain of the horizontal cells network, if 0, then the mean value of the output is zero, if the parameter is near 1, then, the luminance is not filtered and is still reachable at the output, typicall value is 0
    * @param tau2: the time constant of the first order low pass filter of the horizontal cells, use it to cut low temporal frequencies (local luminance variations), unit is frames, typical value is 1 frame, as the photoreceptors
    * @param k2: the spatial constant of the first order low pass filter of the horizontal cells, use it to cut low spatial frequencies (local luminance), unit is pixels, typical value is 5 pixel, this value is also used for local contrast computing when computing the local contrast adaptation at the ganglion cells level (Inner Plexiform Layer parvocellular channel model)
    * @param V0CompressionParameter: the compression strengh of the ganglion cells local adaptation output, set a value between 160 and 250 for best results, a high value increases more the low value sensitivity... and the output saturates faster, recommended value: 230
