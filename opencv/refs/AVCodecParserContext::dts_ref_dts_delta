     * Offset of the current timestamp against last timestamp sync point in
     * units of AVCodecContext.time_base.
     *
     * Set to INT_MIN when dts_sync_point unused. Otherwise, it must
     * contain a valid timestamp offset.
     *
     * Note that the timestamp of sync point has usually a nonzero
     * dts_ref_dts_delta, which refers to the previous sync point. Offset of
     * the next frame after timestamp sync point will be usually 1.
     *
     * For example, this corresponds to H.264 cpb_removal_delay.
