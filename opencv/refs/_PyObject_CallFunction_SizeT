     Call the method named m of object o with a variable number of
     C arguments.  The C arguments are described by a mkvalue
     format string.  The format may be NULL, indicating that no
     arguments are provided. Returns the result of the call on
     success, or NULL on failure.  This is the equivalent of the
     Python expression: o.method(args).
