  *
  * In most cases it is probably better to simply use the reversed expression
  * of a matrix. However, when reversing the matrix data itself is really needed,
  * then this &quot;in-place&quot; version is probably the right choice because it provides
  * the following additional features:
  *  - less error prone: doing the same operation with .reverse() requires special care:
  *    \code m = m.reverse().eval(); \endcode
  *  - this API allows to avoid creating a temporary (the current implementation creates a temporary, but that could be avoided using swap)
  *  - it allows future optimizations (cache friendliness, etc.)
