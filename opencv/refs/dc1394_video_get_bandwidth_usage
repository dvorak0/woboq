 * Gets the bandwidth usage of a camera.
 *
 * This function returns the bandwidth that is used by the camera *IF* ISO was ON.
 * The returned value is in bandwidth units. The 1394 bus has 4915 bandwidth units
 * available per cycle. Each unit corresponds to the time it takes to send one
 * quadlet at ISO speed S1600. The bandwidth usage at S400 is thus four times the
 * number of quadlets per packet. Thanks to Krisitian Hogsberg for clarifying this.
