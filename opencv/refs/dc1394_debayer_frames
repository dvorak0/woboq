 * De-mosaicing of a Bayer-encoded video frame
 *
 * To set the format of the output, simply set the values of the corresponding fields in the output frame
 * @param in is a pointer to the bayer video frame that is to be converted
 * @param out is a pointer to the frame to be converted to.  If there is memory allocated to the image field, 
 *      then it will be adjusted accordingly by this function.  If there is no memory allocated to the image
 *      field, then ensure that out-&gt;image == NULL and out-&gt;allocated_image_bytes == 0
 * @param method is the bayer method to interpolate the frame.
