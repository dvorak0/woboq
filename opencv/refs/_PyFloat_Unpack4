 * argument, true if the string is in little-endian format (exponent
 * last, at p+3 or p+7), false if big-endian (exponent first, at p).
 * Return value:  The unpacked double.  On error, this is -1.0 and
 * PyErr_Occurred() is true (and an exception is set, most likely
 * OverflowError).  Note that on a non-IEEE platform this will refuse
