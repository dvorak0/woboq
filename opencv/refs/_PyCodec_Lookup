<doc f='include/python2.7/codecs.h' l='30'>/* Codec register lookup API.

   Looks up the given encoding and returns a CodecInfo object with
   function attributes which implement the different aspects of
   processing the encoding.

   The encoding string is looked up converted to all lower-case
   characters. This makes encodings looked up through this mechanism
   effectively case-insensitive.

   If no codec is found, a KeyError is set and NULL returned.

   As side effect, this tries to load the encodings package, if not
   yet done. This is part of the lazy load strategy for the encodings
   package.
