 * struct v4l2_buffer - video buffer info
 * @index:	id number of the buffer
 * @type:	enum v4l2_buf_type; buffer type (type == *_MPLANE for
 *		multiplanar buffers);
 * @bytesused:	number of bytes occupied by data in the buffer (payload);
 *		unused (set to 0) for multiplanar buffers
 * @flags:	buffer informational flags
 * @field:	enum v4l2_field; field order of the image in the buffer
 * @timestamp:	frame timestamp
 * @timecode:	frame timecode
 * @sequence:	sequence count of this frame
 * @memory:	enum v4l2_memory; the method, in which the actual video data is
 *		passed
 * @offset:	for non-multiplanar buffers with memory == V4L2_MEMORY_MMAP;
 *		offset from the start of the device memory for this plane,
 *		(or a &quot;cookie&quot; that should be passed to mmap() as offset)
 * @userptr:	for non-multiplanar buffers with memory == V4L2_MEMORY_USERPTR;
 *		a userspace pointer pointing to this buffer
 * @fd:		for non-multiplanar buffers with memory == V4L2_MEMORY_DMABUF;
 *		a userspace file descriptor associated with this buffer
 * @planes:	for multiplanar buffers; userspace pointer to the array of plane
 *		info structs for this buffer
 * @length:	size in bytes of the buffer (NOT its payload) for single-plane
 *		buffers (when type != *_MPLANE); number of elements in the
 *		planes array for multi-plane buffers
 * @input:	input number from which the video data has has been captured
 *
 * Contains data exchanged by application and driver using one of the Streaming
 * I/O methods.
