     * Codec delay.
     *
     * Video:
     *   Number of frames the decoded output will be delayed relative to the
     *   encoded input.
     *
     * Audio:
     *   For encoding, this is the number of &quot;priming&quot; samples added to the
     *   beginning of the stream. The decoded output will be delayed by this
     *   many samples relative to the input to the encoder. Note that this
     *   field is purely informational and does not directly affect the pts
     *   output by the encoder, which should always be based on the actual
     *   presentation time, including any delay.
     *   For decoding, this is the number of samples the decoder needs to
     *   output before the decoder&apos;s output is valid. When seeking, you should
     *   start decoding this many samples prior to your desired seek point.
     *
     * - encoding: Set by libavcodec.
     * - decoding: Set by libavcodec.
