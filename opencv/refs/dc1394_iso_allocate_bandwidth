 * dc1394_iso_allocate_bandwidth:
 * @param camera A camera handle.
 * @param bandwidth_units The number of isochronous bandwidth units to allocate.
 *
 * Allocates isochronous bandwidth.  This functions allocates bandwidth
 * _in addition_ to any previous allocations.  It may be called multiple
 * times.  The bandwidth is automatically re-allocated if there is a bus
 * reset.  The bandwidth is automatically released if this camera is freed
 * or the application shuts down prematurely.  If the bandwidth needs to
 * persist beyond the lifetime of this application, call
 * \a dc1394_iso_set_persist() first.
 *
 * @return \a DC1394_SUCCESS if the operation succeeded.
 * \a DC1394_FUNCTION_NOT_SUPPORTED if the current driver/platform does not
 * allow bandwidth allocation. \a DC1394_NO_BANDWIDTH if there is not enough
 * available bandwidth to support the allocation.  In this case,
 * no bandwidth is allocated.
