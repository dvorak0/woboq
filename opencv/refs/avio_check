 * Return AVIO_FLAG_* access flags corresponding to the access permissions
 * of the resource in url, or a negative value corresponding to an
 * AVERROR code in case of failure. The returned access flags are

 * @note This function is intrinsically unsafe, in the sense that the
 * checked resource may change its existence or permission status from
 * one call to another. Thus you should not trust the returned value,
 * unless you are sure that no other processes are accessing the
 * checked resource.
