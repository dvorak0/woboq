     *
     * For the SVD decomposition of a n-by-p matrix, letting \a m be the minimum of \a n and \a p,
     * the U matrix is n-by-n if you asked for #ComputeFullU, and is n-by-m if you asked for #ComputeThinU.
     *
     * The \a m first columns of \a U are the left singular vectors of the matrix being decomposed.
     *
     * This method asserts that you asked for \a U to be computed.
