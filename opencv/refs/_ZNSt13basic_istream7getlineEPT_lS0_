       *  @brief  String extraction.
       *  @param  __s  A character array in which to store the data.
       *  @param  __n  Maximum number of characters to extract.
       *  @param  __delim  A &quot;stop&quot; character.
       *  @return  *this
       *
       *  Extracts and stores characters into @a __s until one of the
       *  following happens.  Note that these criteria are required to be
       *  tested in the order listed here, to allow an input line to exactly
       *  fill the @a __s array without setting failbit.
       *
       *  -# the input sequence reaches end-of-file, in which case eofbit
       *     is set in the stream error state
       *  -# the next character equals @c __delim, in which case the character
       *     is extracted (and therefore counted in @c gcount()) but not stored
       *  -# @c __n-1 characters are stored, in which case failbit is set
       *     in the stream error state
       *
       *  If no characters are extracted, failbit is set.  (An empty line of
       *  input should therefore not cause failbit to be set.)
       *
       *  In any case, a null character is stored in the next location in
       *  the array.
