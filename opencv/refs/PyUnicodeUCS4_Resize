<doc f='include/python2.7/unicodeobject.h' l='497'>/* Resize an already allocated Unicode object to the new size length.

   *unicode is modified to point to the new (resized) object and 0
   returned on success.

   This API may only be called by the function which also called the
   Unicode constructor. The refcount on the object must be 1. Otherwise,
   an error is returned.

   Error handling is implemented as follows: an exception is set, -1
   is returned and *unicode left untouched.
