     * Real base framerate of the stream.
     * This is the lowest framerate with which all timestamps can be
     * represented accurately (it is the least common multiple of all
     * framerates in the stream). Note, this value is just a guess!
     * For example, if the time base is 1/90000 and all frames have either
     * approximately 3600 or 1800 timer ticks, then r_frame_rate will be 50/1.
