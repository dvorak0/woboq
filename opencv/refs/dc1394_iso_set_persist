<doc f='include/dc1394/iso.h' l='40'>/**
 * dc1394_iso_set_persist
 * @param camera A camera handle.
 *
 * Calling this function will cause isochronous channel and bandwidth
 * allocations to persist beyond the lifetime of this dc1394camera_t
 * instance.  Normally (when this function is not called), any allocations
 * would be automatically released upon freeing this camera or a
 * premature shutdown of the application (if possible).  For this function
 * to be used, it must be called prior to any allocations or an error will
 * be returned.
 *
 * @return \a DC1394_SUCCESS if the operation succeeded.
 * \a DC1394_FUNCTION_NOT_SUPPORTED if the current platform/driver does not
 * allow persistent allocations.
