 * GtkProgress/GtkProgressBar had serious problems in GTK 1.2.
 *
 *  - Only 3 or 4 functions are really needed for 95% of progress
 *    interfaces; GtkProgress[Bar] had about 25 functions, and
 *    didn&apos;t even include these 3 or 4.
 *  - In activity mode, the API involves setting the adjustment
 *    to any random value, just to have the side effect of
 *    calling the progress bar update function - the adjustment
 *    is totally ignored in activity mode
 *  - You set the activity step as a pixel value, which means to
 *    set the activity step you basically need to connect to
 *    size_allocate
 *  - There are ctree_set_expander_style()-functions, to randomly
 *    change look-and-feel for no good reason
 *  - The split between GtkProgress and GtkProgressBar makes no sense
 *    to me whatsoever.
 *
 * This was a big wart on GTK and made people waste lots of time,
 * both learning and using the interface.
 *
 * So, I have added what I feel is the correct API, and marked all the
 * rest deprecated. However, the changes are 100% backward-compatible and
 * should break no existing code.
 *
 * The following 9 functions are the new programming interface.
