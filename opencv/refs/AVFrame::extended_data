     * pointers to the data planes/channels.
     *
     * For video, this should simply point to data[].
     *
     * For planar audio, each channel has a separate data pointer, and
     * linesize[0] contains the size of each channel buffer.
     * For packed audio, there is just one data pointer, and linesize[0]
     * contains the total size of the buffer for all channels.
     *
     * Note: Both data and extended_data will always be set by get_buffer(),
     * but for planar audio with more channels that can fit in data,
     * extended_data must be used by the decoder in order to access all
     * channels.
     *
     * encoding: set by user
     * decoding: set by AVCodecContext.get_buffer()
