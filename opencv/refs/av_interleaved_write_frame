<doc f='include/libavformat/avformat.h' l='1453'>/**
 * Write a packet to an output media file ensuring correct interleaving.
 *
 * The packet must contain one audio or video frame.
 * If the packets are already correctly interleaved, the application should
 * call av_write_frame() instead as it is slightly faster. It is also important
 * to keep in mind that completely non-interleaved input will need huge amounts
 * of memory to interleave with this, so it is preferable to interleave at the
 * demuxer level.
 *
 * @param s media file handle
 * @param pkt The packet containing the data to be written. Libavformat takes
 * ownership of the data and will free it when it sees fit using the packet&apos;s
 * @ref AVPacket.destruct &quot;destruct&quot; field. The caller must not access the data
 * after this function returns, as it may already be freed.
 * This can be NULL (at any time, not just at the end), to flush the
 * interleaving queues.
 * Packet&apos;s @ref AVPacket.stream_index &quot;stream_index&quot; field must be set to the
 * index of the corresponding stream in @ref AVFormatContext.streams
 * &quot;s.streams&quot;.
 * It is very strongly recommended that timing information (@ref AVPacket.pts
 * &quot;pts&quot;, @ref AVPacket.dts &quot;dts&quot; @ref AVPacket.duration &quot;duration&quot;) is set to
 * correct values.
 *
 * @return 0 on success, a negative AVERROR on error.
