<doc f='include/python2.7/abstract.h' l='572'>/* Copy len bytes of data from the contiguous chunk of memory
       pointed to by buf into the buffer exported by obj.  Return
       0 on success and return -1 and raise a PyBuffer_Error on
       error (i.e. the object does not have a buffer interface or
       it is not working).

       If fort is &apos;F&apos; and the object is multi-dimensional,
       then the data will be copied into the array in
       Fortran-style (first dimension varies the fastest).  If
       fort is &apos;C&apos;, then the data will be copied into the array
       in C-style (last dimension varies the fastest).  If fort
       is &apos;A&apos;, then it does not matter and the copy will be made
       in whatever way is more efficient.
