<doc f='include/dc1394/camera.h' l='188'>/**
 * Resets the IEEE1394 bus which camera is attached to.  Calling this function is
 * &quot;rude&quot; to other devices because it causes them to re-enumerate on the bus and
 * may cause a temporary disruption in their current activities.  Thus, use it
 * sparingly.  Its primary use is if a program shuts down uncleanly and needs to
 * free leftover ISO channels or bandwidth.  A bus reset will free those things
 * as a side effect.
