        *Constructor
        *\param w the width of the input image
        *\param h the height of the input image
        *\param center the transformation center: where the output precision is maximal
        *\param R the number of rings of the cortical image (default value 70 pixel)
        *\param ro0 the radius of the blind spot (default value 3 pixel)
        *\param full \a 1 (default value) means that the retinal image (the inverse transform) is computed within the circumscribing circle.
        *            \a 0 means that the retinal image is computed within the inscribed circle.
        *\param S the number of sectors of the cortical image (default value 70 pixel).
        *         Its value is usually internally computed to obtain a pixel aspect ratio equals to 1.
        *\param sp \a 1 (default value) means that the parameter \a S is internally computed.
        *          \a 0 means that the parameter \a S is provided by the user.
