 * Returns DC1394_TRUE if the given frame (previously dequeued) has been
 * detected to be corrupt (missing data, corrupted data, overrun buffer, etc.).
 * Note that certain types of corruption may go undetected in which case
 * DC1394_FALSE will be returned.  The ability to detect corruption also
 * varies between platforms.  Note that corrupt frames still need to be
 * enqueued with dc1394_capture_enqueue() when no longer needed by the user.
