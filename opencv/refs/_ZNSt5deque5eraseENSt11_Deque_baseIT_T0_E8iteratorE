       *  @brief  Remove element at given position.
       *  @param  __position  Iterator pointing to element to be erased.
       *  @return  An iterator pointing to the next element (or end()).
       *
       *  This function will erase the element at the given position and thus
       *  shorten the %deque by one.
       *
       *  The user is cautioned that
       *  this function only erases the element, and that if the element is
       *  itself a pointer, the pointed-to memory is not touched in any way.
       *  Managing the pointer is the user&apos;s responsibility.
