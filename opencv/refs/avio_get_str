 * Read a string from pb into buf. The reading will terminate when either
 * a NULL character was encountered, maxlen bytes have been read, or nothing
 * more can be read from pb. The result is guaranteed to be NULL-terminated, it
 * will be truncated if buf is too small.
 * Note that the string is not interpreted or validated in any way, it
 * might get truncated in the middle of a sequence for multi-byte encodings.
 *
 * @return number of bytes read (is always &lt;= maxlen).
 * If reading ends on EOF or error, the return value will be one more than
 * bytes actually read.
