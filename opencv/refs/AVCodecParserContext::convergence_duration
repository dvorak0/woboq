     * Time difference in stream time base units from the pts of this
     * packet to the point at which the output from the decoder has converged
     * independent from the availability of previous frames. That is, the
     * frames are virtually identical no matter if decoding started from
     * the very first frame or from this keyframe.
     * Is AV_NOPTS_VALUE if unknown.
     * This field is not the display duration of the current frame.
     * This field has no meaning if the packet does not have AV_PKT_FLAG_KEY
     * set.
     *
     * The purpose of this field is to allow seeking in streams that have no
     * keyframes in the conventional sense. It corresponds to the
     * recovery point SEI in H.264 and match_time_delta in NUT. It is also
     * essential for some types of subtitle streams to ensure that all
     * subtitles are correctly displayed after seeking.
