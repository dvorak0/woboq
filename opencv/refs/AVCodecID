 * Identify the syntax and semantics of the bitstream.
 * The principle is roughly:
 * Two decoders with the same ID can decode the same streams.
 * Two encoders with the same ID can encode compatible streams.
 * There may be slight deviations from the principle due to implementation
 * details.
 *
 * If you add a codec ID to this list, add it so that
 * 1. no value of a existing codec ID changes (that would break ABI),
 * 2. it is as close as possible to similar codecs.
 *
 * After adding new codec IDs, do not forget to add an entry to the codec
 * descriptor list and bump libavcodec minor version.
