  // For example, &quot;bar///foo&quot; becomes &quot;bar/foo&quot;. Does not eliminate other
  // redundancies that might be in a pathname involving &quot;.&quot; or &quot;..&quot;.
  //
  // A pathname with multiple consecutive separators may occur either through
  // user error or as a result of some scripts or APIs that generate a pathname
  // with a trailing separator. On other platforms the same API or script
  // may NOT generate a pathname with a trailing &quot;/&quot;. Then elsewhere that
  // pathname may have another &quot;/&quot; and pathname components added to it,
  // without checking for the separator already being there.
  // The script language and operating system may allow paths like &quot;foo//bar&quot;
  // but some of the functions in FilePath will not handle that correctly. In
  // particular, RemoveTrailingPathSeparator() only removes one separator, and
  // it is called in CreateDirectoriesRecursively() assuming that it will change
  // a pathname from directory syntax (trailing separator) to filename syntax.
  //
  // On Windows this method also replaces the alternate path separator &apos;/&apos; with
  // the primary path separator &apos;\\&apos;, so that for example &quot;bar\\/\\foo&quot; becomes
  // &quot;bar\\foo&quot;.</doc>
