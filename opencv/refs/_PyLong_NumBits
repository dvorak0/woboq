<doc f='include/python2.7/longobject.h' l='70'>/* _PyLong_NumBits.  Return the number of bits needed to represent the
   absolute value of a long.  For example, this returns 1 for 1 and -1, 2
   for 2 and -2, and 2 for 3 and -3.  It returns 0 for 0.
   v must not be NULL, and must be a normalized long.
   (size_t)-1 is returned and OverflowError set if the true result doesn&apos;t
   fit in a size_t.
