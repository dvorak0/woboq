 * Allocate a buffer, reusing the given one if large enough.

 * Contrary to av_fast_realloc the current buffer contents might not be
 * preserved and on error the old buffer is freed, thus no special
 * handling to avoid memleaks is necessary.

 * @param ptr pointer to pointer to already allocated buffer, overwritten with pointer to new buffer
 * @param size size of the buffer *ptr points to
 * @param min_size minimum size of *ptr buffer after returning, *ptr will be NULL and
 *                 *size 0 if an error occurred.
