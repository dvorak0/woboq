 * Seek to timestamp ts.
 * Seeking will be done so that the point from which all active streams
 * can be presented successfully will be closest to ts and within min/max_ts.
 * Active streams are all streams that have AVStream.discard &lt; AVDISCARD_ALL.
 *
 * If flags contain AVSEEK_FLAG_BYTE, then all timestamps are in bytes and
 * are the file position (this may not be supported by all demuxers).
 * If flags contain AVSEEK_FLAG_FRAME, then all timestamps are in frames
 * in the stream with stream_index (this may not be supported by all demuxers).
 * Otherwise all timestamps are in units of the stream selected by stream_index
 * or if stream_index is -1, in AV_TIME_BASE units.
 * If flags contain AVSEEK_FLAG_ANY, then non-keyframes are treated as
 * keyframes (this may not be supported by all demuxers).
 *
 * @param stream_index index of the stream which is used as time base reference
 * @param min_ts smallest acceptable timestamp
 * @param ts target timestamp
 * @param max_ts largest acceptable timestamp
 * @param flags flags
 * @return &gt;=0 on success, error code otherwise
 *
 * @note This is part of the new seek API which is still under construction.
 *       Thus do not use this yet. It may change at any time, do not expect
 *       ABI compatibility yet!
