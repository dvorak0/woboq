       *  @brief  Removes first element.
       *
       *  This is a typical %queue operation.  It shrinks the %queue
       *  by one.  The time complexity of the operation depends on the
       *  underlying sequence.
       *
       *  Note that no data is returned, and if the first element&apos;s
       *  data is needed, it should be retrieved before pop() is
       *  called.
