 * AtkPropertyValues:
 * @property_name: The name of the ATK property which is being presented or which has been changed.
 * @old_value: The old property value, NULL; in some contexts this value is undefined (see note below).
 * @new_value: The new value of the named property.
 *
 * Note: for most properties the old_value field of #AtkPropertyValues
 * will not contain a valid value.
 *
 * Currently, the only property for which old_value is used is
 * accessible-state; for instance if there is a focus state the
 * property change handler will be called for the object which lost the focus
 * with the old_value containing an #AtkState value corresponding to focused
 * and the property change handler will be called for the object which
 * received the focus with the new_value containing an #AtkState value
 * corresponding to focused.
