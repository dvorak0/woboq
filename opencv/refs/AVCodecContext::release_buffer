     * Called to release buffers which were allocated with get_buffer.
     * A released buffer can be reused in get_buffer().
     * pic.data[*] must be set to NULL.
     * May be called from a different thread if frame multithreading is used,
     * but not by more than one thread at once, so does not need to be reentrant.
     * - encoding: unused
     * - decoding: Set by libavcodec, user can override.
