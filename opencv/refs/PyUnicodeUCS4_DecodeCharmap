<doc f='include/python2.7/unicodeobject.h' l='1013'>/* --- Character Map Codecs -----------------------------------------------

   This codec uses mappings to encode and decode characters.

   Decoding mappings must map single string characters to single
   Unicode characters, integers (which are then interpreted as Unicode
   ordinals) or None (meaning &quot;undefined mapping&quot; and causing an
   error).

   Encoding mappings must map single Unicode characters to single
   string characters, integers (which are then interpreted as Latin-1
   ordinals) or None (meaning &quot;undefined mapping&quot; and causing an
   error).

   If a character lookup fails with a LookupError, the character is
   copied as-is meaning that its ordinal value will be interpreted as
   Unicode or Latin-1 ordinal resp. Because of this mappings only need
   to contain those mappings which map characters to different code
   points.
