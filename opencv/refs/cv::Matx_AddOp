 A short numerical vector.

 This template class represents short numerical vectors (of 1, 2, 3, 4 ... elements)
 on which you can perform basic arithmetical operations, access individual elements using [] operator etc.
 The vectors are allocated on stack, as opposite to std::valarray, std::vector, cv::Mat etc.,
 which elements are dynamically allocated in the heap.

 The template takes 2 parameters:
 -# _Tp element type
 -# cn the number of elements

 In addition to the universal notation like Vec&lt;float, 3&gt;, you can use shorter aliases
 for the most popular specialized variants of Vec, e.g. Vec3f ~ Vec&lt;float, 3&gt;.
