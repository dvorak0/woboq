<doc f='include/python2.7/longobject.h' l='37'>/* _PyLong_Frexp returns a double x and an exponent e such that the
   true value is approximately equal to x * 2**e.  e is &gt;= 0.  x is
   0.0 if and only if the input is 0 (in which case, e and x are both
   zeroes); otherwise, 0.5 &lt;= abs(x) &lt; 1.0.  On overflow, which is
   possible if the number of bits doesn&apos;t fit into a Py_ssize_t, sets
   OverflowError and returns -1.0 for x, 0 for e. */</doc>
