 * struct v4l2_exportbuffer - export of video buffer as DMABUF file descriptor
 *
 * @index:	id number of the buffer
 * @type:	enum v4l2_buf_type; buffer type (type == *_MPLANE for
 *		multiplanar buffers);
 * @plane:	index of the plane to be exported, 0 for single plane queues
 * @flags:	flags for newly created file, currently only O_CLOEXEC is
 *		supported, refer to manual of open syscall for more details
 * @fd:		file descriptor associated with DMABUF (set by driver)
 *
 * Contains data used for exporting a video buffer as DMABUF file descriptor.
 * The buffer is identified by a &apos;cookie&apos; returned by VIDIOC_QUERYBUF
 * (identical to the cookie used to mmap() the buffer to userspace). All
 * reserved fields must be set to zero. The field reserved0 is expected to
 * become a structure &apos;type&apos; allowing an alternative layout of the structure
 * content. Therefore this field should not be used for any other extensions.
