      *
      * \returns expression object representing the matrix H
      *
      * \pre Either the constructor HessenbergDecomposition(const MatrixType&amp;)
      * or the member function compute(const MatrixType&amp;) has been called
      * before to compute the Hessenberg decomposition of a matrix.
      *
      * The object returned by this function constructs the Hessenberg matrix H
      * when it is assigned to a matrix or otherwise evaluated. The matrix H is
      * constructed from the packed matrix as returned by packedMatrix(): The
      * upper part (including the subdiagonal) of the packed matrix contains
      * the matrix H. It may sometimes be better to directly use the packed
      * matrix instead of constructing the matrix H.
      *
      * Example: \include HessenbergDecomposition_matrixH.cpp
      * Output: \verbinclude HessenbergDecomposition_matrixH.out
      *
      * \sa matrixQ(), packedMatrix()
