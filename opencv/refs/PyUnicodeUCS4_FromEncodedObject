<doc f='include/python2.7/unicodeobject.h' l='516'>/* Coerce obj to an Unicode object and return a reference with
   *incremented* refcount.

   Coercion is done in the following way:

   1. String and other char buffer compatible objects are decoded
      under the assumptions that they contain data using the current
      default encoding. Decoding is done in &quot;strict&quot; mode.

   2. All other objects (including Unicode objects) raise an
      exception.

   The API returns NULL in case of an error. The caller is responsible
   for decref&apos;ing the returned objects.
