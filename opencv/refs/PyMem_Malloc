<doc f='include/python2.7/pymem.h' l='42'>/* Functions

   Functions supplying platform-independent semantics for malloc/realloc/
   free.  These functions make sure that allocating 0 bytes returns a distinct
   non-NULL pointer (whenever possible -- if we&apos;re flat out of memory, NULL
   may be returned), even if the platform malloc and realloc don&apos;t.
   Returned pointers must be checked for NULL explicitly.  No action is
   performed on failure (no exception is set, no warning is printed, etc).
