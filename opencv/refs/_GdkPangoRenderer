 * GdkPangoRenderer:
 *
 * #GdkPangoRenderer is a subclass of #PangoRenderer used for rendering
 * Pango objects into GDK drawables. The default renderer for a particular
 * screen is obtained with gdk_pango_renderer_get_default(); Pango
 * functions like pango_renderer_draw_layout() and
 * pango_renderer_draw_layout_line() are then used to draw objects with
 * the renderer.
 *
 * In most simple cases, applications can just use gdk_draw_layout(), and
 * don&apos;t need to directly use #GdkPangoRenderer at all. Using the
 * #GdkPangoRenderer directly is most useful when working with a
 * transformation such as a rotation, because the Pango drawing functions
 * take user space coordinates (coordinates before the transformation)
 * instead of device coordinates.
 *
 * In certain cases it can be useful to subclass #GdkPangoRenderer. Examples
 * of reasons to do this are to add handling of custom attributes by
 * overriding &apos;prepare_run&apos; or to do custom drawing of embedded objects
 * by overriding &apos;draw_shape&apos;.
 *
 * Since: 2.6
