     * If non NULL, &apos;draw_horiz_band&apos; is called by the libavcodec
     * decoder to draw a horizontal band. It improves cache usage. Not
     * all codecs can do that. You must check the codec capabilities
     * beforehand.
     * When multithreading is used, it may be called from multiple threads
     * at the same time; threads might draw different parts of the same AVFrame,
     * or multiple AVFrames, and there is no guarantee that slices will be drawn
     * in order.
     * The function is also used by hardware acceleration APIs.
     * It is called at least once during frame decoding to pass
     * the data needed for hardware render.
     * In that mode instead of pixel data, AVFrame points to
     * a structure specific to the acceleration API. The application
     * reads the structure and can change some fields to indicate progress
     * or mark state.
     * - encoding: unused
     * - decoding: Set by user.
     * @param height the height of the slice
