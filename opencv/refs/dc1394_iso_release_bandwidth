 * dc1394_iso_release_bandwidth:
 * @param camera A camera handle.
 * @param bandwidth_units The number of isochronous bandwidth units to free.
 *
 * Releases previously allocated isochronous bandwidth.  Each \a dc1394camera_t
 * keeps track of a running total of bandwidth that has been allocated.
 * Released bandwidth is subtracted from this total for the sake of
 * automatic re-allocation and automatic release on shutdown.  It is also
 * acceptable for a camera to release more bandwidth than it has allocated
 * (to clean up for another process for example).  In this case, the
 * running total of bandwidth is not affected.  It is acceptable to
 * release more bandwidth than is allocated in total for the bus.  In this
 * case, all bandwidth is released and the function succeeds.
 *
 * @return \a DC1394_SUCCESS if the operation succeeded.
 * \a DC1394_FUNCTION_NOT_SUPPORTED if the current driver/platform does not
 * allow bandwidth release.
