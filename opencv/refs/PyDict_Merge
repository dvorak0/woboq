<doc f='include/python2.7/dictobject.h' l='131'>/* PyDict_Merge updates/merges from a mapping object (an object that
   supports PyMapping_Keys() and PyObject_GetItem()).  If override is true,
   the last occurrence of a key wins, else the first.  The Python
   dict.update(other) is equivalent to PyDict_Merge(dict, other, 1).
