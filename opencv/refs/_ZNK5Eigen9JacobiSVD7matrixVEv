     *
     * For the SVD decomposition of a n-by-p matrix, letting \a m be the minimum of \a n and \a p,
     * the V matrix is p-by-p if you asked for #ComputeFullV, and is p-by-m if you asked for ComputeThinV.
     *
     * The \a m first columns of \a V are the right singular vectors of the matrix being decomposed.
     *
     * This method asserts that you asked for \a V to be computed.
