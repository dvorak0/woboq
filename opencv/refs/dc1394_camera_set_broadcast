 * Sets and gets the broadcast flag of a camera. If the broadcast flag is set,
 * all devices on the bus will execute the command. Useful to sync ISO start
 * commands or setting a bunch of cameras at the same time. Broadcast only works
 * with identical devices (brand/model). If the devices are not identical your
 * mileage may vary. Some cameras may not answer broadcast commands at all. Also,
 * this only works with cameras on the SAME bus (IOW, the same port).
