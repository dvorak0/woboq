  Returns the number of CPU ticks.

  On platforms where the feature is available, the function returns the number of CPU ticks
  since the certain event (normally, the system power-on moment). Using this function
  one can accurately measure the execution time of very small code fragments,
  for which cv::getTickCount() granularity is not enough.
