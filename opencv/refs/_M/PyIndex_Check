     int PyNumber_Coerce(PyObject **p1, PyObject **p2);

     This function takes the addresses of two variables of type
     PyObject*.

     If the objects pointed to by *p1 and *p2 have the same type,
     increment their reference count and return 0 (success).
     If the objects can be converted to a common numeric type,
     replace *p1 and *p2 by their converted value (with &apos;new&apos;
     reference counts), and return 0.
     If no conversion is possible, or if some other error occurs,
     return -1 (failure) and don&apos;t increment the reference counts.
     The call PyNumber_Coerce(&amp;o1, &amp;o2) is equivalent to the Python
     statement o1, o2 = coerce(o1, o2).
