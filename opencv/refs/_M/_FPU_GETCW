   work around a bug in older versions of GCC.  __volatile__ is used
   to support combination of writing the control register and reading
   it back.  Without __volatile__, the old value may be used for reading
   back under compiler optimization.

   Note that the use of these macros is not sufficient anymore with
   recent hardware nor on x86-64.  Some floating point operations are
   executed in the SSE/SSE2 engines which have their own control and
   status register.  */</doc>
