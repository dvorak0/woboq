 * The following are ``pseudo tags&apos;&apos; that can be used to control
 * codec-specific functionality.  These tags are not written to file.
 * Note that these values start at 0xffff+1 so that they&apos;ll never
 * collide with Aldus-assigned tags.

 * If you want your private pseudo tags ``registered&apos;&apos; (i.e. added to
 * this file), please post a bug report via the tracking system at
 * http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/bugs.html with the appropriate
 * C definitions to add.
