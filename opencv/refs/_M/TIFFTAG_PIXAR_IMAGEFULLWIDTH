 * TIFFTAG_PIXAR_IMAGEFULLWIDTH and TIFFTAG_PIXAR_IMAGEFULLLENGTH
 * are set when an image has been cropped out of a larger image.  
 * They reflect the size of the original uncropped image.
 * The TIFFTAG_XPOSITION and TIFFTAG_YPOSITION can be used
 * to determine the position of the smaller image in the larger one.
