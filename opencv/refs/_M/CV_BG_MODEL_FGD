<doc f='opencv/modules/legacy/include/opencv2/legacy/legacy.hpp' l='3142'>/* We discriminate between foreground and background pixels
 * by building and maintaining a model of the background.
 * Any pixel which does not fit this model is then deemed
 * to be foreground.
 *
 * At present we support two core background models,
 * one of which has two variations:
 *
 *  o CV_BG_MODEL_FGD: latest and greatest algorithm, described in
 *
 *	 Foreground Object Detection from Videos Containing Complex Background.
 *	 Liyuan Li, Weimin Huang, Irene Y.H. Gu, and Qi Tian.
 *	 ACM MM2003 9p
 *
 *  o CV_BG_MODEL_FGD_SIMPLE:
 *       A code comment describes this as a simplified version of the above,
 *       but the code is in fact currently identical
 *
 *  o CV_BG_MODEL_MOG: &quot;Mixture of Gaussians&quot;, older algorithm, described in
 *
 *       Moving target classification and tracking from real-time video.
