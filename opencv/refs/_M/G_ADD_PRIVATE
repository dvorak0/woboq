 * G_ADD_PRIVATE:
 * @TypeName: the name of the type in CamelCase
 *
 * A convenience macro to ease adding private data to instances of a new type
 * in the @_C_ section of G_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_CODE() or
 * G_DEFINE_ABSTRACT_TYPE_WITH_CODE().
 *
 * For instance:
 *
 * |[
 *   typedef struct _MyObject MyObject;
 *   typedef struct _MyObjectClass MyObjectClass;
 *
 *   typedef struct {
 *     gint foo;
 *     gint bar;
 *   } MyObjectPrivate;
 *
 *   G_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_CODE (MyObject, my_object, G_TYPE_OBJECT,
 *                            G_ADD_PRIVATE (MyObject))
 * ]|
 *
 * Will add MyObjectPrivate as the private data to any instance of the MyObject
 * type.
 *
 * G_DEFINE_TYPE_* macros will automatically create a private function
 * based on the arguments to this macro, which can be used to safely
 * retrieve the private data from an instance of the type; for instance:
 *
 * |[
 *   gint
 *   my_object_get_foo (MyObject *obj)
 *   {
 *     MyObjectPrivate *priv = my_object_get_instance_private (obj);
 *
 *     return priv-&gt;foo;
 *   }
 *
 *   void
 *   my_object_set_bar (MyObject *obj,
 *                      gint      bar)
 *   {
 *     MyObjectPrivate *priv = my_object_get_instance_private (obj);
 *
 *     if (priv-&gt;bar != bar)
 *       priv-&gt;bar = bar;
 *   }
 * ]|
 *
 * Note that this macro can only be used together with the G_DEFINE_TYPE_*
 * macros, since it depends on variable names from those macros.
 *
 * Also note that private structs added with these macros must have a struct
 * name of the form &lt;replaceable&gt;TypeName&lt;/replaceable&gt;Private.
 *
 * Since: 2.38
