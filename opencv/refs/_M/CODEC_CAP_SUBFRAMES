 * Codec can output multiple frames per AVPacket
 * Normally demuxers return one frame at a time, demuxers which do not do
 * are connected to a parser to split what they return into proper frames.
 * This flag is reserved to the very rare category of codecs which have a
 * bitstream that cannot be split into frames without timeconsuming
 * operations like full decoding. Demuxers carring such bitstreams thus
 * may return multiple frames in a packet. This has many disadvantages like
 * prohibiting stream copy in many cases thus it should only be considered
 * as a last resort.
