 * @def PUT_UTF16(val, tmp, PUT_16BIT)
 * Convert a 32-bit Unicode character to its UTF-16 encoded form (2 or 4 bytes).
 * @param val is an input-only argument and should be of type uint32_t. It holds
 * a UCS-4 encoded Unicode character that is to be converted to UTF-16. If
 * val is given as a function it is executed only once.
 * @param tmp is a temporary variable and should be of type uint16_t. It
 * represents an intermediate value during conversion that is to be
 * output by PUT_16BIT.
 * @param PUT_16BIT writes the converted UTF-16 data to any proper destination
 * in desired endianness. It could be a function or a statement, and uses tmp
 * as the input byte.  For example, PUT_BYTE could be &quot;*output++ = tmp;&quot;
 * PUT_BYTE will be executed 1 or 2 times depending on input character.
