   by receivers.
   If the framerate of the format is a multiple of six, then the pixelclock
   used to set up the transmitter is divided by 1.001 to make it compatible
   with 60 Hz based standards such as NTSC and PAL-M that use a framerate of
   29.97 Hz. Otherwise this flag is cleared. If the transmitter can&apos;t generate
   such frequencies, then the flag will also be cleared. */</doc>
