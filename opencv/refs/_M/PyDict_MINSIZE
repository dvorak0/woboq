<doc f='include/python2.7/dictobject.h' l='40'>/* PyDict_MINSIZE is the minimum size of a dictionary.  This many slots are
 * allocated directly in the dict object (in the ma_smalltable member).
 * It must be a power of 2, and at least 4.  8 allows dicts with no more
 * than 5 active entries to live in ma_smalltable (and so avoid an
 * additional malloc); instrumentation suggested this suffices for the
 * majority of dicts (consisting mostly of usually-small instance dicts and
 * usually-small dicts created to pass keyword arguments).
