 * Maximum number of components (color channels) allowed in JPEG image.
 * To meet the letter of the JPEG spec, set this to 255.  However, darn
 * few applications need more than 4 channels (maybe 5 for CMYK + alpha
 * mask).  We recommend 10 as a reasonable compromise; use 4 if you are
 * really short on memory.  (Each allowed component costs a hundred or so
 * bytes of storage, whether actually used in an image or not.)
