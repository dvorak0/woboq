  We represent a graph as a set of vertices.
  Vertices contain their adjacency lists (more exactly, pointers to first incoming or
  outcoming edge (or 0 if isolated vertex)). Edges are stored in another set.
  There is a singly-linked list of incoming/outcoming edges for each vertex.

  Each edge consists of

     o   Two pointers to the starting and ending vertices
         (vtx[0] and vtx[1] respectively).

   A graph may be oriented or not. In the latter case, edges between
   vertex i to vertex j are not distinguished during search operations.

     o   Two pointers to next edges for the starting and ending vertices, where
         next[0] points to the next edge in the vtx[0] adjacency list and
         next[1] points to the next edge in the vtx[1] adjacency list.
