 * cvCreateTrainingSamples
 *
 * Create training samples applying random distortions to sample image and
 * store them in .vec file
 *
 * filename        - .vec file name
 * imgfilename     - sample image file name
 * bgcolor         - background color for sample image
 * bgthreshold     - background color threshold. Pixels those colors are in range
 *   [bgcolor-bgthreshold, bgcolor+bgthreshold] are considered as transparent
 * bgfilename      - background description file name. If not NULL samples
 *   will be put on arbitrary background
 * count           - desired number of samples
 * invert          - if not 0 sample foreground pixels will be inverted
 *   if invert == CV_RANDOM_INVERT then samples will be inverted randomly
 * maxintensitydev - desired max intensity deviation of foreground samples pixels
 * maxxangle       - max rotation angles
 * maxyangle
 * maxzangle
 * showsamples     - if not 0 samples will be shown
 * winwidth        - desired samples width
 * winheight       - desired samples height
