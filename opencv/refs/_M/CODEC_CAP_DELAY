 * Encoder or decoder requires flushing with NULL input at the end in order to
 * give the complete and correct output.
 *
 * NOTE: If this flag is not set, the codec is guaranteed to never be fed with
 *       with NULL data. The user can still send NULL data to the public encode
 *       or decode function, but libavcodec will not pass it along to the codec
 *       unless this flag is set.
 *
 * Decoders:
 * The decoder has a non-zero delay and needs to be fed with avpkt-&gt;data=NULL,
 * avpkt-&gt;size=0 at the end to get the delayed data until the decoder no longer
 * returns frames.
 *
 * Encoders:
 * The encoder needs to be fed with NULL data at the end of encoding until the
 * encoder no longer returns data.
 *
 * NOTE: For encoders implementing the AVCodec.encode2() function, setting this
 *       flag also means that the encoder must set the pts and duration for
 *       each output packet. If this flag is not set, the pts and duration will
 *       be determined by libavcodec from the input frame.
