 * @def PUT_UTF8(val, tmp, PUT_BYTE)
 * Convert a 32-bit Unicode character to its UTF-8 encoded form (up to 4 bytes long).
 * @param val is an input-only argument and should be of type uint32_t. It holds
 * a UCS-4 encoded Unicode character that is to be converted to UTF-8. If
 * val is given as a function it is executed only once.
 * @param tmp is a temporary variable and should be of type uint8_t. It
 * represents an intermediate value during conversion that is to be
 * output by PUT_BYTE.
 * @param PUT_BYTE writes the converted UTF-8 bytes to any proper destination.
 * It could be a function or a statement, and uses tmp as the input byte.
 * For example, PUT_BYTE could be &quot;*output++ = tmp;&quot; PUT_BYTE will be
 * executed up to 4 times for values in the valid UTF-8 range and up to
 * 7 times in the general case, depending on the length of the converted
 * Unicode character.
