 * Py_ADJUST_ERANGE2(x, y)
 * Set errno to 0 before calling a libm function, and invoke one of these
 * macros after, passing the function result(s) (Py_ADJUST_ERANGE2 is useful
 * for functions returning complex results).  This makes two kinds of
 * adjustments to errno:  (A) If it looks like the platform libm set
 * errno=ERANGE due to underflow, clear errno. (B) If it looks like the
 * platform libm overflowed but didn&apos;t set errno, force errno to ERANGE.  In
 * effect, we&apos;re trying to force a useful implementation of C89 errno
 * behavior.
 * Caution:
 *    This isn&apos;t reliable.  See Py_OVERFLOWED comments.
 *    X and Y may be evaluated more than once.
