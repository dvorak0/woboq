       *  This function erases an element, pointed to by the given iterator,
       *  from a %multiset.  Note that this function only erases the element,
       *  and that if the element is itself a pointer, the pointed-to memory is
       *  not touched in any way.  Managing the pointer is the user&apos;s
       *  responsibility.
