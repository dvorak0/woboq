     * Converts an arbitrary array into a valid generator state.
     * First we normalize x[0], so that it contains the same
     * value we would get by running the generator forwards
     * and then in reverse.  (The low order r bits are redundant).
     * Then, if the state consists of all zeros, we set the
     * high order bit of x[0] to 1.  This function only needs to
     * be called by seed, since the state transform preserves
     * this relationship.
