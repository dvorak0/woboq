   * Find the set of variables to be relinearized according to
   * relinearizeThreshold. This check is performed recursively, starting at
   * the top of the tree. Once a variable in the tree does not need to be
   * relinearized, no further checks in that branch are performed. This is an
   * approximation of the Full version, designed to save time at the expense
   * of accuracy.
   * @param delta The linear delta to check against the threshold
   * @param keyFormatter Formatter for printing nonlinear keys during
   * debugging
   * @return The set of variable indices in delta whose magnitude is greater
   * than or equal to relinearizeThreshold
