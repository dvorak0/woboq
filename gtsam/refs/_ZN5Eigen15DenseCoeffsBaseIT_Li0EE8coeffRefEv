<doc f='codebrowser/gtsam/3rdparty/Eigen/Eigen/src/Core/DenseCoeffsBase.h' l='269'>// explanation: DenseBase is doing &quot;using ...&quot; on the methods from DenseCoeffsBase.
    // But some methods are only available in the DirectAccess case.
    // So we add dummy methods here with these names, so that &quot;using... &quot; doesn&apos;t fail.
    // It&apos;s not private so that the child class DenseBase can access them, and it&apos;s not public
    // either since it&apos;s an implementation detail, so has to be protected.</doc>
