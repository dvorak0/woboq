<doc f='codebrowser/gtsam/3rdparty/Spectra/Util/SimpleRandom.h' l='17'>// We need a simple pseudo random number generator here:
// 1. It is used to generate initial and restarted residual vector.
// 2. It is not necessary to be so &quot;random&quot; and advanced. All we hope
//    is that the residual vector is not in the space spanned by the
//    current Krylov space. This should be met almost surely.
// 3. We don&apos;t want to call RNG in C++, since we actually want the
//    algorithm to be deterministic. Also, calling RNG in C/C++ is not
//    allowed in R packages submitted to CRAN.
// 4. The method should be as simple as possible, so an LCG is enough.

// Given a 32-bit integer as the seed, generate a pseudo random 32-bit integer</doc>
