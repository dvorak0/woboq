<doc f='codebrowser/gtsam/3rdparty/Eigen/Eigen/src/QR/CompleteOrthogonalDecomposition.h' l='301'>/** Allows to prescribe a threshold to be used by certain methods, such as
   * rank(), who need to determine when pivots are to be considered nonzero.
   * Most be called before calling compute().
   *
   * When it needs to get the threshold value, Eigen calls threshold(). By
   * default, this uses a formula to automatically determine a reasonable
   * threshold. Once you have called the present method
   * setThreshold(const RealScalar&amp;), your value is used instead.
   *
   * \param threshold The new value to use as the threshold.
   *
   * A pivot will be considered nonzero if its absolute value is strictly
   * greater than
   *  \f$ \vert pivot \vert \leqslant threshold \times \vert maxpivot \vert \f$
   * where maxpivot is the biggest pivot.
   *
   * If you want to come back to the default behavior, call
   * setThreshold(Default_t)
