<doc f='include/boost/archive/basic_xml_iarchive.hpp' l='82'>// specific overrides for attributes - handle as
    // primitives. These are not name-value pairs
    // so they have to be intercepted here and passed on to load.
    // although the class_id is included in the xml text file in order
    // to make the file self describing, it isn&apos;t used when loading
    // an xml archive.  So we can skip it here.  Note: we MUST override
    // it otherwise it will be loaded as a normal primitive w/o tag and
    // leaving the archive in an undetermined state</doc>
