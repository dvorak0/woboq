<doc f='include/boost/filesystem/path.hpp' l='903'>//  -----  observers  -----

    //  For operating systems that format file paths differently than directory
    //  paths, return values from observers are formatted as file names unless there
    //  is a trailing separator, in which case returns are formatted as directory
    //  paths. POSIX and Windows make no such distinction.

    //  Implementations are permitted to return const values or const references.

    //  The string or path returned by an observer are specified as being formatted
    //  as &quot;native&quot; or &quot;generic&quot;.
    //
    //  For POSIX, these are all the same format; slashes and backslashes are as input and
    //  are not modified.
    //
    //  For Windows,   native:    as input; slashes and backslashes are not modified;
    //                            this is the format of the internally stored string.
    //                 generic:   backslashes are converted to slashes
