       *  @brief  Multiple character extraction.
       *  @param  __s  A buffer area.
       *  @param  __n  Maximum number of characters to assign.
       *  @return  The number of characters assigned.
       *
       *  Fills @a __s[0] through @a __s[__n-1] with characters from the input
       *  sequence, as if by @c sbumpc().  Stops when either @a __n characters
       *  have been copied, or when @c traits::eof() would be copied.

       *  It is expected that derived classes provide a more efficient
       *  implementation by overriding this definition.
