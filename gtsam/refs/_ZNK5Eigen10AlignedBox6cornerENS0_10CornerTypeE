    * the corner-id corner. It works only for a 1D, 2D or 3D bounding box.
    * For 1D bounding boxes corners are named by 2 enum constants:
    * BottomLeft and BottomRight.
    * For 2D bounding boxes, corners are named by 4 enum constants:
    * BottomLeft, BottomRight, TopLeft, TopRight.
    * For 3D bounding boxes, the following names are added:
    * BottomLeftCeil, BottomRightCeil, TopLeftCeil, TopRightCeil.
