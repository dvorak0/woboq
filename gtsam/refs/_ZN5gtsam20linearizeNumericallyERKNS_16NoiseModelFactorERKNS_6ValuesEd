 * Linearize a nonlinear factor using numerical differentiation
 * The benefit of this method is that it does not need to know what types are
 * involved to evaluate the factor. If all the machinery of gtsam is working
 * correctly, we should get the correct numerical derivatives out the other side.
 * NOTE(frank): factors that have non vector-space measurements use between or LocalCoordinates
 * to evaluate the error, and their derivatives will only be correct for near-zero errors.
 * This is fixable but expensive, and does not matter in practice as most factors will sit near
 * zero errors anyway. However, it means that below will only be exact for the correct measurement.
