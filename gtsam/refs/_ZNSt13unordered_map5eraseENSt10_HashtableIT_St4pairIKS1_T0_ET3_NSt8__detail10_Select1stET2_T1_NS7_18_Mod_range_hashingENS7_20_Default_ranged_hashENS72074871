       *  @brief Erases an element from an %unordered_map.
       *  @param  __position  An iterator pointing to the element to be erased.
       *  @return An iterator pointing to the element immediately following
       *          @a __position prior to the element being erased. If no such

       *  This function erases an element, pointed to by the given iterator,
       *  from an %unordered_map.
       *  Note that this function only erases the element, and that if the
       *  element is itself a pointer, the pointed-to memory is not touched in
       *  any way.  Managing the pointer is the user&apos;s responsibility.
