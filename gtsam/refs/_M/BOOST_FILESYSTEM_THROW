//
//  Exceptions were originally thrown via boost::throw_exception().
//  As throw_exception() became more complex, it caused user error reporting
//  to be harder to interpret, since the exception reported became much more complex.
//  The immediate fix was to throw directly, wrapped in a macro to make any later change
//  easier.</doc>
