   * Get (partial) labels by performing a visit.
   *
   * This method performs a depth-first search to go to every leaf and records
   * the keys assignment which leads to that leaf. Since the tree can be pruned,
   * there might be a leaf at a lower depth which results in a partial
   * assignment (i.e. not all keys are specified).
   *
   * E.g. given a tree with 3 keys, there may be a branch where the 3rd key has
   * the same values for all the leaves. This leads to the branch being pruned
   * so we get a leaf which is arrived at by just the first 2 keys and their
   * assignments.
