      *
      * The returned expression can directly be used to perform matrix products. It can also be assigned to a dense Matrix object.
      * Here is an example showing how to recover the full or thin matrix Q, as well as how to perform matrix products using operator*:
      *
      * Example: \include HouseholderQR_householderQ.cpp
      * Output: \verbinclude HouseholderQR_householderQ.out
