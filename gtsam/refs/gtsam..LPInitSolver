 * This LPInitSolver implements the strategy in Matlab:
 * http://www.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/linear-programming-algorithms.html#brozyzb-9
 * Solve for x and y:
 *    min y
 *    st Ax = b
 *       Cx - y &lt;= d
 * where \f$y \in R\f$, \f$x \in R^n\f$, and Ax = b and Cx &lt;= d is the constraints of the original problem.
 *
 * If the solution for this problem {x*,y*} has y* &lt;= 0, we&apos;ll have x* a feasible initial point
 * of the original problem
 * otherwise, if y* &gt; 0 or the problem has no solution, the original problem is infeasible.
 *
 * The initial value of this initial problem can be found by solving
 *    min   ||x||^2
 *    s.t.   Ax = b
 * to have a solution x0
 * then y = max_j ( Cj*x0  - dj )  -- due to the constraints y &gt;= Cx - d
 *
 * WARNING: If some xj in the inequality constraints does not exist in the equality constraints,
 * set them as zero for now. If that is the case, the original problem doesn&apos;t have a unique
 * solution (it could be either infeasible or unbounded).
 * So, if the initialization fails because we enforce xj=0 in the problematic
 * inequality constraint, we can&apos;t conclude that the problem is infeasible.
 * However, whether it is infeasible or unbounded, we don&apos;t have a unique solution anyway.
