<doc f='codebrowser/gtsam/3rdparty/ceres/jet.h' l='485'>// Jet Classification. It is not clear what the appropriate semantics are for
// these classifications. This picks that IsFinite and isnormal are &quot;all&quot;
// operations, i.e. all elements of the jet must be finite for the jet itself
// to be finite (or normal). For IsNaN and IsInfinite, the answer is less
// clear. This takes a &quot;any&quot; approach for IsNaN and IsInfinite such that if any
// part of a jet is nan or inf, then the entire jet is nan or inf. This leads
// to strange situations like a jet can be both IsInfinite and IsNaN, but in
// practice the &quot;any&quot; semantics are the most useful for e.g. checking that
// derivatives are sane.

// The jet is finite if all parts of the jet are finite.</doc>
