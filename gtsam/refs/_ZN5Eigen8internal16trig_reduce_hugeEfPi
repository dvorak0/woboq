// It has been largely optimized:
//  - By-pass calls to frexp.
//  - Aligned loads of required 96 bits of 2/pi. This is accomplished by
//    (1) balancing the mantissa and exponent to the required bits of 2/pi are
//    aligned on 8-bits, and (2) replicating the storage of the bits of 2/pi.
//  - Avoid a branch in rounding and extraction of the remaining fractional part.
// Overall, I measured a speed up higher than x2 on x86-64.</doc>
