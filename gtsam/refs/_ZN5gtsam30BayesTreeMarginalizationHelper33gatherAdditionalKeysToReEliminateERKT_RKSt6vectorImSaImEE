   * This function identifies variables that need to be re-eliminated before
   * performing marginalization.
   * 
   * Re-elimination is necessary for a clique containing marginalizable
   * variables if:
   * 
   * 1. Some non-marginalizable variables appear before marginalizable ones
   *    in that clique;
   * 2. Or it has a child node depending on a marginalizable variable AND the
   *    subtree rooted at that child contains non-marginalizables.
   * 
   * In addition, for any descendant node depending on a marginalizable
   * variable, if the subtree rooted at that descendant contains
   * non-marginalizable variables (i.e., it lies on a path from one of the
   * aforementioned cliques that require re-elimination to a node containing
   * non-marginalizable variables at the leaf side), then it also needs to
   * be re-eliminated.
   * 
   * @param[in] bayesTree The Bayes tree
   * @param[in] marginalizableKeys Keys to be marginalized
   * @return Set of additional keys that need to be re-eliminated
