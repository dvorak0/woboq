   * *this is the complete orthogonal decomposition. It has only linear
   * complexity (that is, O(n) where n is the dimension of the square matrix)
   * as the complete orthogonal decomposition has already been computed.
   *
   * \note This is only for square matrices.
   *
   * \warning a determinant can be very big or small, so for matrices
   * of large enough dimension, there is a risk of overflow/underflow.
   * One way to work around that is to use logAbsDeterminant() instead.
