       *
       *  You can get a copy of the pointer that this object owns, for
       *  situations such as passing to a function which only accepts
       *  a raw pointer.
       *
       *  @note  This %auto_ptr no longer owns the memory.  When this object
       *  goes out of scope, nothing will happen.
