       *  @brief  Extraction into another streambuf.
       *  @param  __sb  A streambuf in which to store data.
       *  @param  __delim  A &quot;stop&quot; character.
       *  @return  *this
       *
       *  Characters are extracted and inserted into @a __sb until one of the
       *  following happens:
       *
       *  - the input sequence reaches EOF
       *  - insertion into the output buffer fails (in this case, the
       *    character that would have been inserted is not extracted)
       *  - the next character equals @a __delim (in this case, the character
       *    is not extracted)
       *  - an exception occurs (and in this case is caught)
       *
       * If no characters are stored, failbit is set in the stream&apos;s error
       * state.
