<doc f='codebrowser/gtsam/base/cholesky.h' l='24'>/**
 * &quot;Careful&quot; Cholesky computes the positive square-root of a positive symmetric
 * semi-definite matrix (i.e. that may be rank-deficient).  Unlike standard
 * Cholesky, the square-root factor may have all-zero rows for free variables.
 *
 * Additionally, this function returns the index of the row after the last
 * non-zero row in the computed factor, so that it may be truncated to an
 * upper-trapazoidal matrix.
 *
 * The second element of the return value is \c true if the matrix was factored
 * successfully, or \c false if it was non-positive-semidefinite (i.e.
 * indefinite or negative-(semi-)definite.
 *
 * Note that this returned index is the rank of the matrix if and only if all
 * of the zero-rows of the factor occur after any non-zero rows.  This is
 * (always?) the case during elimination of a fully-constrained least-squares
 * problem.
 *
 * The optional order argument specifies the size of the square upper-left
 * submatrix to operate on, ignoring the rest of the matrix.
