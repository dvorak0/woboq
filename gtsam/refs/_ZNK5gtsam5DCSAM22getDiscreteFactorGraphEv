   * NOTE: not obviously correct (see DCSAM.cpp implementation) at the moment.
   * Should perhaps retrieve the marginals for the factor graph obtained as
   * isam_.getFactorsUnsafe() and `dfg_` rather than taking as a parameter?
   * I think this was originally intended to mimic the gtsam `Marginals` class.
