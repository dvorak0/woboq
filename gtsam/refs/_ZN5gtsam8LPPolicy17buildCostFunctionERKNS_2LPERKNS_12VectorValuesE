   * Create the factor ||x-xk - (-g)||^2 where xk is the current feasible solution
   * on the constraint surface and g is the gradient of the linear cost,
   * i.e. -g is the direction we wish to follow to decrease the cost.
   *
   * Essentially, we try to match the direction d = x-xk with -g as much as possible
   * subject to the condition that x needs to be on the constraint surface, i.e., d is
   * along the surface&apos;s subspace.
   *
   * The least-square solution of this quadratic subject to a set of linear constraints
   * is the projection of the gradient onto the constraints&apos; subspace
